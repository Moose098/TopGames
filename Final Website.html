<p>The Legend of Zelda is often reffered to as one of Nintendo's most popular franchises. Of these open world games, there is no Zelda game that has more to explore than BotW. You play as Link, a knight of the Kingdom of Hyrule. The game has virtually no end with 120 Shrines (mini dungeons) many larger and more complex dungeons, 76 Sidequests, 42 Shrine Quests, and infinitely more. Fans can look forward to BotW 2, which is supposed to come out Spring of 2023. The limitless world of BotW's Hyrule. is an obvious addition. <a href="https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

	<p>This advanced fighting game is arguably the best of its genre. Players can choose from 81 different fighters to play as, each equipped with a wide variety of attacks and abilities. The goal is to launch your opponents offscreen and you get launched farther depending on the amount of damage you have taken. You can also play Adventure Mode or Classic Mode where players challenge NPCs. This game introduces a mechanic called Spirits where the player can equip special skills/abilities like starting battles with an item or having increased movement. Aside from Spirits, gameplay hasn't changed much from the series' previous games. <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/index.html" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

	<p>The vast underground world of Hollownest is filled with in-depth lore, treasure, and creatrures of all kinds. Every inch of the world is incredibly well deisgned. Greenpath,the underground forest, is lively and beautiful. Deepnest, the insect infested dark catacombs, has a chilling atmosphere to say the least. This game has more mini bosses and main bosses than any game I can think of. Conquering the colluseum was the most fun for me so I recmend checxking that place out. <a href="https://www.hollowknight.com/" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

	<h3>WARNING: Trailer contains gore</h3>
  <p>Doom Eternal received five Game of the Year nominations and is easily the best of the FPS genre. Humans are near extinction with demons consuming Earth. Their only hope of survival is you. As the Slayer, you battle through vast hordes of demons to stop Hell's invasion of Earth. You have access to a countless array of upgradable weapons and new abilities like the Blood Punch and Double Dash. <c>"The only thing they fear... is you."</c> <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/doom" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
